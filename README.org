* Dotfiles

Here are the configurations for some programs that I use.

* Emacs

I have such a complete emacs config, it has a pretty gruvbox theme (my
favourite), lsp, magit, org-mode looks amazing, it uses *tabs instead of*
*spaces* and overwrites some default emacs commands so it works in a way that I
like it more.

** Installation

To install it, all you have to do is just to clone the project and symlink both
files in the /emacs/ folder to your home directory:

#+begin_src bash
  cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/0xd011f4ce/dotfiles
  ln -s /home/<user>/dotfiles/emacs/.emacs ~
  ln -s /home/<user>/dotfiles/emacs/.emacs.c
#+end_src

An after that, just fire up emacs and it will automatically install all the
required packages.

*NOTE*: In the /.emacs.c/ folder there are some files (like the /erc/ in the
/packages/ folder) that is literally just to connect to irc servers when emacs
is started in server mode, you can remove those files, and all the other things
that you don't want (it won't crash if any file inside /.emacs.c/ is missing)

** Keybinds

*NOTICE*: This might won't be updated, I will be comparing this file with the
actual emacs config so all the keybindings and changes are here ðŸ¤—

I've modified some things and there are some keybinds unique to my config, here
are some:

| Keybind          | Command                            |
|------------------+------------------------------------|
| <f8>             | treemacs                           |
| C-c C-y (or TAB) | yas-expand                         |
| C-c m            | mc/mark-all-like-this              |
| M-RET            | lsp-ui-sideline-apply-code-actions |
| C-c s            | ispell-word                        |
| C-c f            | ispell-buffer                      |

And there are also the keybinds from normal packages like /C-x g/ for magit
and well, you know all those, if not, check the packages in the /.emacs/ file
and rtfm

** Custom scripts

The /.emacs.c/ folder contains custom scripts that override some default
behaviours of emacs, here are some of them:

*** better-defaults

This file is called /better-defaults/ because I overwrite some default emacs
configurations so they work *better* for me, hence the name.

What it does for now is that it overrides the behaviour of /C-v/ and /M-v/ to
insert a mark before scrolling so I can come back to that position nicely with
/C-u C-SPC/. Here are all the new keybindings.

| Keybind | Command                  | Description                          |
|---------+--------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| C-c RET | my/set-mark-here         | Creates a mark at the point position |
