* Dotfiles

Here are the configurations for some programs that I use.

* Emacs

I have such a complete emacs config, it has a pretty gruvbox theme (my
favourite), lsp, magit, org-mode looks amazing, it uses *tabs instead of*
*spaces* and overwrites some default emacs commands so it works in a way that I
like it more.

** Installation

To install it, all you have to do is just to clone the project and symlink both
files in the /emacs/ folder to your home directory:

#+begin_src bash
  cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/0xd011f4ce/dotfiles
  ln -s /home/<user>/dotfiles/emacs/.emacs ~
  ln -s /home/<user>/dotfiles/emacs/.emacs.c
#+end_src

An after that, just fire up emacs and it will automatically install all the
required packages.

*NOTE*: In the /.emacs.c/ folder there are some files (like the /erc/ in the
/packages/ folder) that is literally just to connect to irc servers when emacs
is started in server mode, you can remove those files, and all the other things
that you don't want (it won't crash if any file inside /.emacs.c/ is missing)

** Keybinds

These are the custom keybinds of my emacs config:

| Keybind          | Command                                                                     |
|------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <f8>             | treemacs                                                                    |
| C-c C-y (or TAB) | yas-expand                                                                  |
| C-c m            | mc/mark-all-like-this                                                       |
| C-c s            | ispell-word                                                                 |
| C-c f            | ispell-buffer                                                               |
| s-n              | tab-bar-new-tab                                                             |
| s-w              | tab-bar-close-tab                                                           |
| s-<n>            | <n> represents a number from 1-9 and it will execute /tab-bar-select-tab <n>/ |
| s-<left>         | other-window -1 (select window left)                                        |
| s-<right>        | other-window 1 (select window right)                                        |
