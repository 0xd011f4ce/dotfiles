* Dotfiles

Here are the configurations for some programs that I use.

** Emacs

I have a huge emacs config, it has the dracula theme and other packages like,
lsp, magit, org-mode looks amazing, it uses *tabs instead of *spaces* and a lot of
other cool features.

*** Installation

To install it, all you have to do is just to clone the project and symlink both
files in the /emacs/ folder to your home directory:

#+begin_src bash
  cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/0xd011f4ce/dotfiles
  ln -s /home/<user>/dotfiles/emacs/.emacs ~
  ln -s /home/<user>/dotfiles/emacs/.emacs.c
#+end_src

And after that, just fire up emacs and it will automatically install all the
required packages.

*** Keybinds

These are the custom keybinds of my emacs config:

| C-c a      | org-agenda            |
| C-c c      | org-capture           |

** Zsh

My zsh config is nothing special, I just use ohmyzsh, a few plugins and one of
the default themes, I don't really spend that much time ricing a shell.
